    Enumeration type for the single target track state. Newly created tracks are
    classified as `tentative` until enough evidence has been collected. Then,

    A single target track with state space `(x, y, a, h)` and associated

    Parameters
    ----------
    mean : ndarray
        Mean vector of the initial state distribution.
    covariance : ndarray
        Covariance matrix of the initial state distribution.
    track_id : int
        A unique track identifier.
    n_init : int
        Number of consecutive detections before the track is confirmed. The
        track state is set to `Deleted` if a miss occurs within the first
        `n_init` frames.
    max_age : int
        The maximum number of consecutive misses before the track state is
        set to `Deleted`.
    feature : Optional[ndarray]
        Feature vector of the detection this track originates from. If not None,
