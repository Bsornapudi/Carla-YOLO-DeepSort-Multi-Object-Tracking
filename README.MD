# Multi Vehicle tracking in carla simulator 

This repo host a comprehensive solution for multi-object tracking in combination with YOLO and DeepSORT in carla simulator .
YOLOV8 model is trained on Carla dataset , which is avaiable in kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alechantson/carladataset)

Following software are required before installing required packages

1. Carla simulator : Download Carla simulator and follow the instuction guide - https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/start_quickstart/
2. CUDA : Download and install CUDA - https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads
3. CuDnn : Install Cuda DNN - https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/cudnn/install-guide/index.html
4. Anacoda : https://www.anaconda.com/download
5. PyMOT : Download / clone this repo for evaluations - https://github.com/Videmo/pymot
6. Create and activate a new virtural conda env 

    ```
    conda create --name <env-name> python=3.8
    conda activate <env-name> 
        NOTE : <env-name> should be the name of your virtural env
    ```
7. Install required packages
    ```
    pip install  requirements.txt
    ```
8. Once the setup is done Run Calra.exe file to launch simulator
9. One commapnd prompt or launch jupyter from conda prompt
10. Run track.ipynb file in jupyter 
 
NOTE : 

step to check PyTorch compatibility and install an appropriate version based on their CUDA and cuDNN configurations from this link , scroll down and you will see an option to select your system configs and tis will generate PIP INSTALL for CUDnn+torch which is compatable
